                                    "Singapore is a dynamic and diverse city-state located at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula in Southeast Asia. Renowned for its blend of modernity and tradition, lush green spaces, and multicultural society, Singapore offers a wealth of experiences for travelers. Singapore is widely recognized as one of the safest cities in the world, thanks to its strict law enforcement, low crime rates, and overall emphasis on public safety." - ChatGPT, 2024

                                    While there are four official languages in Singapore (English, Mandarin, Malay, and Tamil), English is the main language of administration and is widely spoken, so it should be pretty convenient for international travelers. There are only two types of weather in Singapore: Hot or Wet. The average temperature is around 30 degree celsius. It is generally a good idea to travel around with an umbrella either to block the sun or the rain. See the latest weather forecast <a href="https://www.weather.gov.sg/home">here</a>.

                            Traveling around singapore is easy and convenient with the public transport system. With a bit more budget, one can also opt for private hires or even rent a car to drive around. Google Maps is pretty accurate and reliable in Singapore.

								<h2>Food</h2>

                            <p>
                            Singapore's hawker centers are one of the "Unesco Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity". Scattered around Singapore, these are outdoor eating places with public seating and many food stalls. A smaller version of it is sometimes called a "kopitiam" or "coffee shop" while an airconditioned version of it (usually in malls) is referred to as a "food court". All of these offer a variety of cheap and tasty food options, depending on rental prices. It is not uncommon to be able to get a meal under SGD$5.
                            </p>

                            Here are some of the well-known hawker centers:

                                <li>Old Airport Rd Food Centre</li>
                                <li>Lau Pat Sat: Pricey and touristy (expect prices above SGD$5), but has good variety and options</li>
                            </ul>

                            Specific dishes to recommend:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Kaya toast and eggs, with drink (Breakfast / Tea break)<br>
                                One of the "traditional" breakfast options in Singapore. <a href="https://toastbox.com.sg/">Toastbox</a> and <a href="http://yakun.com/">Yakun</a> are good "restaurant" options, though you can typically get it much cheaper at any small coffee shop or hawker center. As you can tell by now, non-cafe Singapore coffee is mostly <a href="https://yongsengcoffee.com/blogs/coffee-chats/how-to-brew-kopi-sock">"sock coffee"</a> and the lingo to order one can be <a href="https://blog.seedly.sg/singapore-coffee-kopi-tea-teh-guide-difference-in-price-how-to-order/">complicated</a>. Ordering tea is also similar by just replacing "kopi" (coffee) by "teh" (tea). If you're feeling adventurous, you can also try <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuenyeung">"Yuan Yang"</a> which is a mix of coffee and tea, popularized in Hong Kong.
                                </li>
                                <li>Laksa: <a href="https://www.328katonglaksa.sg/">328 Katong Laksa</a> is a popular choice</li>
                                <li>Curry chicken noodle</li>
                                <li>Satay</li>
                                <li>Fried carrot cake<br>
                                Actually fried daikon and not carrot in the sense of the carrot cake dessert that you are probably more familiar with. They come in white (savory) or black (sweet), and can be fried with or without chili, i.e. 4 options to choose from
                                </li>
                                <li>Hainanese chicken rice: There's a famous stall called <a href="https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/singapore-region/singapore/restaurant/tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice">Tian Tian</a> at <a href="https://maxwellfoodcentre.com/">Maxwell food center</a></li>
                                <li>Chili crab: I would recommend ordering "fried mantou" (some kind of fried dough) to dip the chili crab sauce with</li>
                                <li>Bak kut teh (pork bone broth): In literal english, "Meat, Bone, Soup". There are two variants of it: either a white peppery base or black herbal base. One of the better known white base soup is <a href="https://songfa.com.sg/">Song Fa</a></li>
                                <li>Wanton noodle</li>
                                <li>Minced pork noodle</li>
                                <li>Nasi lemak</li>
                                <li>Nasi briyani</li>
                                <li>Mee siam</li>
                                <li>Mee rebus</li>
                                <li>Roti John</li>

                                <li>Peranakan / Nyonya cuisine: This cuisine is a mix of Chinese and Malay/Indonesia influence</li>
                                <li>Ang Ku Kueh (Snack): Chinese pastry with soft, sticky glutinous rice flour skin wrapped around various types of fillings. A very famous one is <a href="https://sethlui.com/ji-xiang-ang-ku-kueh-family-business-remaining-traditional-gems-singapore/">Ji Xiang</a>. The original Ji Xiang is at Outram and the other Ji Xiangs you see elsewhere are a "spinoff" from one of the brothers. People have differing opinions over which is nicer. I don't know about the spinoff but I personally like the Outram one. Peanut and salted bean are the "standard/traditional" flavors.</li>
                                <li>Curry puff (Snack): Can have just potato fillings and/or chicken and/or sardine</li>
                                <li>Tahu goreng: Fried bean curd with peanut sauce</li>
                                <li>You Tiao (Breakfast / Snack): Fried dough fritter. Goes with by soaking into drinks like soya bean milk!</li>
                                <li>Bakkwa: Honey glazed pork jerky. Traditional Chinese new year snack but people also enjoy it outside of the festival. Chinatown has lots of shops selling this.
                                </li>
